Mule-upload
===========

This is an ES7 javascript implementation of the Google Cloud Storage API which relies on an authorization backend in order to limit in-browser security threats.

It implements multiple parallel chunk uploads in order to boost performance.

# User guide
The muleUploader library is available as an UMD package in `dist/MuleUploader.js`.

The library is exposed under multiple module definitions, allowing it to work with CommonJS, AMD and as global variable.

```
	<script src="MuleUploader.js"></script>
	<script>
		var gcs = new muleUploader.GCSUpload();

		gcs.loadFile(myFile);
		gcs.run();
	</script>
```

Alternatively, you can pass an options object in order to fine tune the uploader :
```
{
	backendURL: "http://localhost:8081/signature",	// the backend url
	backendFetchMode: 'cors',						// cors, no-cors, same-origin, navigate
	backendSecurityMode: 'session',					// session, signed-uri
	parallelChunkUploads: 1,						// how many chunks will be uploaded in parallel
	progressCallback: null,							// a function that will be called with progress status
}
```

A demo of the browser side javascript implementation is available [here](test/index.html).
A demo of the server side authorization implementation is available [here](backends/python/main.py).

# Developers
You can run the stack through a simple `docker-compose up --build`, you might require a key.json in order to have the backend working.
